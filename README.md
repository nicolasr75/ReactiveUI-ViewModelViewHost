# ReactiveUI-ViewModelViewHost
Shows the use of Reactive UIs ViewModelViewHost together with Avalonia UI to create a simple application with a single window but two pages. This might be useful as a starting point for implementing wizard style apps.

The code also shows how to use ReactiveUIs typesafe data binding with Avalonia, which is not self explanatory because in Avalonia you can't directly reference controls via their name. Instead you have to use FindControl. For details see https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/data-binding/avalonia
